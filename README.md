# ![nf-core/tower-action](img/nfcore-toweraction_logo.png)

**A GitHub Action to launch a workflow using [Nextflow Tower](https://tower.nf) - <https://tower.nf>.**

## :warning: :warning: NB: This `master` branch is only for backwards compatability! :warning: :warning:

Because version 2.0 of this action broke backwards compatability, and nf-core pipelines at the time are set up to use `@master`, this branch contains workarounds to ensure that they keep working.

**:point_right: _Going forward, please use `@2` for the latest version under the v2 major release._ :point_left:**

If writing a new action, please do not use this `master` branch. Instead see `main` for the latest stable code.

**Please see the readme on the `main` branch here: https://github.com/nf-core/tower-action/tree/main**

Apologies for the mess.
